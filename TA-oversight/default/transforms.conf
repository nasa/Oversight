# to manage large field lists, they are kept as macros in macros.conf

# No hosts_lookup is defined for hosts_collection. This keeps the fields dyanmic
# without additional configurations, but means that the collection can not be viewed as a lookup.
# Instead, the kvcollection must be viewed through:
# https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/TA-oversight/storage/collections/data/hosts_collection
# https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/TA-oversight/storage/collections/config/hosts_collection
# note hosts_lookup has the filter to only show active records, the hosts_lookup_all is for tracking inactive records, needed for the NMI Report.
